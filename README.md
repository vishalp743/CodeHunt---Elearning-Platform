# CodeHunt Elearning-Platform
<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

E-learning fulfil the thirst of knowledge and offers online content that can be 
delivered for the learner at anywhere, anytime and any age through a wide 
range of e-learning solution while compared with traditional learning system. It 
also provides the rapid access to specific knowledge and information related to 
Programming Languages & Problem Solution. With the rapid growth of 
voluminous information sources and the time constraint the learning 
methodology has changed. Learners obtain knowledge through e-Learning 
systems rather than manually teaching and learning. In this research paper 
proposes the e-learning management system with web services oriented frame 
work . This system supports the cross browser and fully integrated with 
different databases. This system focused around the several features like 
Learning new Programming Languages, Implementing those using Inbuilt 
Compilers/Interpreter, Quiz for each topic, Certification on completion of 
course & so many silent features and mainly focused on integrated platform 
needed for e-learning and managements.

<h3><b>Proposed System </h3></b>
The System we are proposing consist of all of the things stakes together which can be accessible under on 
portal by students providing the latest, knowledge, technologies & practical knowledge using information 
provided by us in form of text, videos & quizzes, Certification exams. 
Our System revolves around 2 major nodes Students & Admin. Student can Access the information store 
on database with the help of student portal & the information accessed by the student can be modified, 
Add or Delete with the help of Admin login from admin portal.</br></br></br></br></br>

<h3>Conclusion </h3>
This project is taking into consideration various techniques that can be used to make a successful “Online programming language learning Platform” for the web.
We also learned the languages and technologies used to obtain the goal of our project. We have successfully designed the application using the technologies such as
-HTML, CSS, JS (Frontend)

-PHP, SQL (Backend)

We are making the use of different techniques and try to minimize the time required and quality of education experience in online learning based platform. Also in this project we are trying to include the important and advance features that make the learning journey of the user easy and enjoyable.
The facilities which we provide students to learn programming languages in more efficient way under a single roof where they can learn from text based, video based tutorial and enhance there skills competing in quiz's
Opening up borders of programming language learning 24-7 with latest and trending topics loaded with detail descriptions and providing implementable infrastructure.
